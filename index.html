        New Palace, Kolhapur is a palace situated in Kolhapur, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The Palace took 7 years to complete, from 1877 to 1884,[1] costing about seven lakhs of rupees.[2] Being an excellent specimen of Indian architecture built in black polished stone, it has been an attraction for tourists. It has extensive premises with a garden, fountain and wrestling ground. The whole building is eight-angled and has a tower in the middle. The clock on it was fixed in 1877. At separate distances there are small towers. On every glass are painted the events in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's life, the founder of Maratha Empire. There is a zoo and a ground lake. Even today, it is the residence of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaja, the direct descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaja.

        The palace has been converted 1987 into a 3-star hotel and has been used as a background for many films. Because of heavy losses it had to be shut down in 2014 and given over to the Municipality. The Palace is built of intricately carved black stone and Italian marble. Rich decorative wooden doorways fitted with etched Belgian glass bearing the crest of the Maharaja of Kolhapur, add to the regal grandeur. Majestic black stone arches form the verandah and the porch. The stained glass windows and the huge tower clock are restored to their original beauty.</p>
